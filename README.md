## Iteration One | Form Funcitonality

- When an activity category is clicked the associated border and icon should change colors to give a visual indication that  it has been selected.
- An input field should be provided for What would you like to accomplish during this time.
- A Start Activity button is provided to submit the data. When the button is clicked, the user should no longer see the      form, and instead see a timer clock. The timer clock should display the minutes a seconds, as well the and description. The   timer should match the color of the activity selected.  
- If the Start Activity button is clicked before the user has entered information into all four inputs, the user will        receive an error message.

## Iteration Three | Logging Past Activities

- When the timer completes, a motivational or congratulatory message appears on the left side of the page, replacing the timer.
- When the user acknowledges the message and completion of the activity by clicking Log Activity, a card with the category, time, and the users input for What would you like to accomplish during this time should appear on the card. The card should also have a small color-coded visual indicator of the category.
